<p align="center">A simple tool to make Git less tiresome!</p>

Uses simple python program it manage cloned repo's

You can clone, list, delete and update repos using this
simple tool.

Many of the git users need to update their repos in 
their local machine but nobody find a way for that.
So, I just write a few lines of code to update the
cloned repo's.

The main feature of this Git Manager is we can update 
our cloned repo's.


note : While you update the repo the previous version 
will not deleted if you not clone that repo using this 
tool.

Pull request and issues are always welcome here if you
got any bugs in this program.
